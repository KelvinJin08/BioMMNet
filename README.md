<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an sample example guides you on how to run project scripts locally by the following simple example steps.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
First, you need to download the checkpoint for [progen2-small](https://github.com/salesforce/progen/tree/main/progen2).
Or run the follwing code.
  ```sh 
  # checkpoint
  model=progen2-small
  wget -P checkpoints/${model} https://storage.googleapis.com/sfr-progen-research/checkpoints/${model}.tar.gz
  tar -xvf checkpoints/${model}/${model}.tar.gz -C checkpoints/${model}/
  ```


Then, you can run the bio_sequence_cli script. 

Simply input what you want the multimodal model to do. 

For example, "Please generate a protein sequence with length 64, and please set the temperature as 0.7."
  ```sh 
  python bio_sequence_cli.py "Please generate a protein sequence with length 256, and please set the temperature as 0.7." 
  ```
